   git clone https://github.com/milance139/BlazorEcommerce.git
   cd BlazorEcommerce
   ```
   
2. **Update Connection Strings:**<br>
   Open the appsettings.json file.<br>
   Update the DefaultConnection string with your SQL Server details
   
4. **Update AppSettings:**<br>
   In the same appsettings.json file, update the JwtToken and create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account to acquire your own 'StripeSecretKey' in the "AppSettings" section
   
6. **Apply Migrations:**<br>
   Execute Entity Framework Core migrations to set up the database schema:
   ```
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
8. **Install and Run Stripe CLI for Webhooks:**<br>
   Download and install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).<br>
   In your terminal, run the following command to listen for webhook events locally:
   ```
   stripe listen --forward-to https://localhost:5001/webhooks/stripe
   ```
   Note: Make sure to replace 'https://localhost:5001' with the actual URL where your application is running.
10. **Launch the Application**<br>
